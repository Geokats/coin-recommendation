# Cryptocoin Hashing, Clustering & Recommendation
This repository contains the code I developed for a project for a university class. It is divided in three parts, each parting building on the previous parts and expanding them.

First I developed two methods for probabilistic hashing on vectors/points.
Following that I implemented multiple clustering methods that use the before-mentioned hashing methods.
Finally using both hashing and clustering, I created a reccomendations system that performs sentiment analysis on a set of tweets that talk about cryptocoins and recommends other types of coins the user might be interested in.
